***Before starting the codes, you will need to download keras and tensorflow 
to be able to run the codes. To do s you must open the Anaconda command prompt
and type the following:

"pip install (type module name)"

You are now all set to run the codes***

-----------

1: When loading spyder, load the python codes:

Ryan_And_Deric_Proj_4_VG1
Ryan_And_Deric_Proj_4_VG2
Ryan_And_Deric_Proj_4_VG3
Ryan_And_Deric_Proj_4_DR
Ryan_And_Deric_Proj_4_WD
Ryan_And_Deric_Proj_4_VDR

Note: current epochs are half of the recommended amount (70-80) 
because of the amount of time it would take us to run each program.
If your PC contains considerable processing power, the time the program would 
take to output the accuracy values decreases.

You can compare your outputs to ours 
from the following PDF file titled in the folder:

"Project_4_Part_1_Outputs"

-----------

2: After running and verifying the accuracy amounts and the graphs,
run the following code:
"Ryan_And_Deric_Proj_4_Final_Prediction"

To test the different images, line 30 of the previously mentioned code
can be changed. Change the commented to 'imagei' where 'i' can be any number
between 1 to 20. Place the image files in the same file as the codes for ease.

NOTE: The 'FINAL.h5' file is used to test the code and its accuracy

-----------

3: Next load the code for part 2 and 4 of the project:

"Ryan_And_Deric_Proj_4" 

The code will simultaneously convert the images to the proper formatting of
32x32x3 that part 2 requests as well as part 4 for the correct classsification.
